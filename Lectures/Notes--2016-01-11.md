## Virtual Circuit Switching

With __Virtual Circuit Switching__ we reserve resources based on previous traffic patterns.

Basically emulates a circuit switched connection using packet. Packets are given resource identifiers that define their destination.

## Internet History

__ARAPAnet__ was developed by DARPA and the US Department of Defence with the goal of passing packets (using packet switching) on a large distributed network. In addition they wanted the communications network to,

* be __redundant__ and resilient to attack, i.e., nodes being destroyed
* support __multiple types of data__ including multiple communication services
* accommodate a __variety of networks__ and infrastructure

### Topologies

| Topology | Delay    | Reliability     | # of Links |
|----------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Mesh     | short    | high            | $O(n^2)$   |
| Ring     | long     | low             | $O(n)$     |
| Star     | long     | low             | $O(n)$     |
| Tree     | $\lg(n)$ | depends on node | $O(n-1)$   |
