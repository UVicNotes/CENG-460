## Overview of Networks

### What is a network?

* End Systems, e.g., computers, phones, servers.
* Communication Links, e.g., cell broadcasts, broadband
* Intermediate Systems, e.g., routers, switches

### Types of Networks

* __Broadcast__
    * Cable TV
* __Switched__
    * Circuit Switching
        * Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
    * Packet Switching
        * The Internet

## Packet Switching

* A method of transmitting data where the data is transformed into chunks called packets which are then shared across a newtork
* Each packet contains an address that directs the packet to its destination
* A channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic
* Used to increase network efficiency by allowing data to be transmitted between multiple start and end points along the same connection in the newtork

### Types of Delay

#### Propagation Delay

* The time that it takes for the packet to reach its destination
* The time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver.

$$
    D_{Prop} = \frac{d}{s} \\\\
    \text{d = distance between nodes}
    \text{s = speed of delivery}
$$

#### Queueing Delay

* The time that a packet waits in a queue before being able to be processed.
* The queue delay is the least stable and is based on the number of packets being sent at a particular time.

#### Processing Delay

* The time it takes for a router to process the packet header
* _i.e_ The time it takes to decide where the packet needs to go, to look for errors and to decrypt and encrypt the packet

#### Transmission Delay (Store-And-Forward Delay)

* The time that it takes for a packet's bits to be sent into the channel
* This happens because it takes time to put the bits of a packet on the channel before those bits are actually sent
* Entirely dependent on the size of the packet.

$$
    D_{T} = \frac{L}{R} \\\\
    \text{$D_T$ is the transmission delay in seconds}\\\\
    \text{$L$ is the number of bits, and} \\\\
    \text{R is the rate of transmission (say in bits per second)}
$$

#### End-To-End Delay

* The total ammount of time for a packet to reeach its destination is

$$
    d_\text{end to end} = d_\text{transmission} + d_\text{propagation} + d_\text{processing} + d_\text{queue}
$$

#### Example

You have a packet that is 7.5 Mbits which goes through 3 routers and each router processes at 1.5 Mbps.

$$
    \underset{\text{routers}}3 \cdot
    \frac
    {
    7.5 ~\text{Megabits}
    }
    {\left(
    \frac{1.5 ~\text{Megabits}}{\text{Second}}
    \right)}
     = 15 ~\text{seconds}
$$

So the total transmission time is 15 seconds
