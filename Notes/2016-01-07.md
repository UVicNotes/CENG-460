## Overview of Networks

### What is a network?

* End Systems, e.g., computers, phones, servers.
* Communication Links, e.g., cell broadcasts, broadband
* Intermediate Systems, e.g., routers, switches


### Types of Networks

* __Broadcast__
    * Cable TV
* __Switched__
    * Circuit Switching
        * Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
    * Packet Switching
        * The Internet

### Packet Switching

Packets must arrive to the router before it is forwarded to its next destination. This is called _store and forward_.

#### Example

You have a packet that is 7.5 Mbits which goes through 3 routers and each router processes at 1.5 Mbps.

$$
    \underset{\text{routers}}3 \cdot
    \frac
    {
    7.5 ~\text{Megabits}
    }
    {\left(
    \frac{1.5 ~\text{Megabits}}{\text{Second}}
    \right)}
     = 15 ~\text{seconds}
$$

So the total transmission time is 15 seconds. The end to end can also be shown as,

$$
    d_\text{end to end} = d_\text{transmission} + d_\text{propagation} + d_\text{processing} + d_\text{queue}
$$

the queue delay is the least stable and is based on the packets in the queue.
