## Switching Technologies

* **Circuit Switched**: Each message requests a transmission line, when granted it transmits on an assigned line.
* **Message Switched**: Messages are sent sequentially on separate lines.
* **Packet Switching**: Packets are sent on separate lines and decoded at the end.

## Multiplexing

* A way of sending multiple signals or streams of information over communications link at the same time.

### Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)
* The total available bandwith in a channel is divided into no overlapping sub channels each of which is used to carry a separate signal
* Typically used for radio

* Example: _Suppose a long-distance cable is available with a bandwidth allotment of three megahertz (3 MHz). This is 3,000 kHz, so in theory, it is possible to place 1,000 signals, each 3 kHz wide, into the long-distance channel. The circuit that does this is known as a multiplexer. It accepts the input from each individual end user, and generates a signal on a different frequency for each of the inputs._

### Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
* Multiplexing is done by using different wavelengths (colors) of light as the sub channels.

* WDM is multiplexing for optical channels

### Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)

* Synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line multiplex and demultiplex the streams of data so that each signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating pattern.

* In the image, when 4 streams are multiplexed using TDM the bits from any particular stream are spaced apart at interval of 4. So bits at `4*i` (`i` is an integer), Come from stream 1 and `4*i + 1` come from stream 2 and so on.
