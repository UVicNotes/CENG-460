### Hamming Code

**[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code)**

_definition_: __Hamming codes__ can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors.

### Correcting Error

For connections were error is low (like wired networks) it can be more efficient to use less parity bits and only detect error. Then we can ask the sender to resend the package.
