Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)   The total available bandwith in a channel is divided into no overlapping sub channels each of which is used to carry a separate signal  Typically used for radio     Example:  Suppose a long-distance cable is available with a bandwidth allotment of three megahertz (3 MHz). This is 3,000 kHz, so in theory, it is possible to place 1,000 signals, each 3 kHz wide, into the long-distance channel. The circuit that does this is known as a multiplexer. It accepts the input from each individual end user, and generates a signal on a different frequency for each of the inputs.  source   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)   Multiplexing is done by using different wavelengths (colors) of light as the sub channels.     WDM is multiplexing for optical channels   Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)   Synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line multiplex and demultiplex the streams of data so that each signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating pattern.     In the image, when 4 streams are multiplexed using TDM the bits from any particular stream are spaced apart at interval of 4. So bits at  4*i  ( i  is an integer), Come from stream 1 and  4*i + 1  come from stream 2 and so on.   Internet Backbone   TO DO",
