Some properties of packet switching are\n\n\n\n\nEach packet contains an address that directs the packet to its destination\n\n\nA channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic\n\n\nIncreases network efficiency by allowing data to be transmitted between multiple start and end points along the same connection in the network\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Delay\n\n\nPropagation Delay\n\n\ndefinition\n: The \npropagation delay\n is the amount of time that it takes for the head of the packet to reach its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n    d_{prop} = \\frac{d}{s}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere $d$ is the distance between the nodes and $s$ is the speed.\n\n\nQueueing Delay\n\n\ndefinition\n: The \nqueueing delay\n is the time that a packet waits in a queue before being able to be processed. \nIt is the least predictable delay\n and is based on the number of packets being sent at a particular time.\n\n\nProcessing Delay\n\n\ndefinition\n: The \nprocessing delay\n the time it takes for a router to process the packet header, \ni.e\n, The time it takes to decide where the packet needs to go, to look for errors and to decrypt and encrypt the packet.\n\n\nTransmission Delay (Store-And-Forward Delay)\n\n\ndefinition\n: The \ntransmission delay\n is the time that it takes for a packet's bits to be sent into the channel. It happens because it takes time to put the bits of a packet on the channel before those bits are actually sent and is very dependant on the packets size. The transmission delay can be expressed as,\n\n\n\n\n\n    d_{trans} = \\frac{L}{R}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere $L$ is the number of bits and $R$ is the rate of transmission (often in bits per second).\n\n\nEnd-To-End Delay\n\n\nThe total amount of time for a packet to reach its destination is\n\n\n\n\n\n    d_\\text{end to end} = d_\\text{transmission} + d_\\text{propagation} + d_\\text{processing} + d_\\text{queue}\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nYou have a packet that is 7.5 Mbits which goes through 3 routers and each router processes at 1.5 Mbps.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\underset{\\text{routers}}3 \\cdot\n    \\frac\n    {\n    7.5 ~\\text{Megabits}\n    }\n    {\\left(\n    \\frac{1.5 ~\\text{Megabits}}{\\text{Second}}\n    \\right)}\n     = 15 ~\\text{seconds}\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the total transmission time is 15 seconds",
